    "The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.",
    "Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called cryptocurrency. The main innovation: a network without a trusted central authority or third parties.",
    "The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone. I want you to be able to visualize it as unchangeable.",
    "Lost coins only make everyone else's coins slightly more valuable. Think of it as a donation to everyone.",
    "The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place.",
    "The double-spending problem is solved by a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work.",
    "If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.",
    "Bitcoin is generated at a speed closer to the planned schedule, and this remains true regardless of how many miners act.",
    "In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes.",
    "Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard. There's nothing to relate it to."
