Execute this protocol with 100% precision:

1. Code Sanitization & Production Cleanup:

Wipe: Remove every console.log, debugger, unused variable, and commented-out code block across the entire project.

Terminology: Update all educational modules. Use "distributed consensus" instead of "immutable/forever". Ensure the wallet section states it manages "private keys", not "stores money".

Hardened Error Handling: Wrap all Nostr and NFC functions in try/catch. On failure, the terminal must output: [SYSTEM_ERROR: MODULE_UNREACHABLE]—no crashes allowed.

2. Architecture Split (The "Bypass" Logic):

Landing (/): Set index.html as the landing page.

App (/activation): Move the fully functional terminal (wallet, Nostr, NFC, UI) to this subdirectory. Update all asset links (JS, CSS, Images) to ensure they resolve correctly under /activation.

3. Landing Page: The Manifesto & Digital Fog:

Manifesto Content: > "The internet has become a digital panopticon. re_terminal is the breach. Post-privacy is our current reality. Offline hardware. Stateless money. Direct signal. Reclaim your digital sovereignty."

Visual Interaction: Implement the "Digital Fog" effect on /. An interactive grey noise/blur layer must cover the screen.

The Reveal: Upon touch or mouse movement, use globalCompositeOperation to "scratch away" the fog, revealing the glowing copper-gradient logo underneath (#D97D45).

CTA: Overlay a flickering monospace prompt: > CLEAR THE FOG TO REVEAL THE SIGNAL_

4. PWA Sovereign Mode (Crucial):

manifest.json: Set "start_url": "/activation".

Behavior: When launched from the home screen icon, the app MUST open the Terminal directly (/activation), completely bypassing the landing page/manifesto.

Offline Support: Configure the Service Worker to cache all assets needed for /activation to ensure the terminal works 100% offline.

5. Mobile & Performance Polish:

Set meta name="viewport" with user-scalable=no specifically for the /activation path to prevent accidental zooming.

Ensure the interactive fog on the landing page is GPU-optimized and doesn't drain the battery.

Once complete, confirm that: 1. The code is sanitized. 2. The PWA starts at /activation. 3. The interactive fog and manifesto are live on the root path.
