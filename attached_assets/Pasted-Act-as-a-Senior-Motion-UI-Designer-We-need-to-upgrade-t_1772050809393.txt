Act as a Senior Motion UI Designer. We need to upgrade the "Surveillance Trap" section from static text into a dynamic, semantic infographic animation using HTML and CSS.

**Target Section:** The block containing "> 60 countries actively censor the internet." and the two arrows below it.

**The Concept ("The Terminal Cascade"):**
Visually represent how censorship leads to a trap. We will use a drawing timeline/tree structure that cascades downwards, culminating in "Financial control" being locked inside a box.

**Implementation Instructions:**

1. **HTML Restructuring:**
- Wrap this specific text block in a new container: `<div class="trap-infographic">`.
- Wrap the main stat `> 60 countries...` in a `div.trap-header`.
- Wrap the next two lines in a `div.trap-tree`. 
- Structure the tree lines so they have a visual connecting line (like a terminal directory tree `├─`).

2. **CSS Drawing Animation (Triggered by .is-visible from IntersectionObserver):**
- **Step 1 (0.0s):** `.trap-header` (`> 60 countries...`) fades in and slides up slightly.
- **Step 2 (0.4s):** A thin 1px vertical black line starts "growing" downwards from the header to the first arrow.
- **Step 3 (0.8s):** The line branches right (`├─`), and `→ Total surveillance` instantly snaps into visibility with a slight horizontal translation.
- **Step 4 (1.2s):** The vertical line continues growing down to the second arrow.
- **Step 5 (1.6s):** It branches right (`└─`), and `→ Financial control` snaps into visibility.
- **Step 6 (2.0s - The Trap):** Instantly, a stark 1px black border draws itself around the words "Financial control". Add a micro-interaction where the background of this specific box quickly flashes black and text flashes white for 100ms, then returns to white background/black text, symbolizing the trap closing.

**Technical Constraints:**
- Use CSS `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to create and animate the growing vertical and horizontal lines.
- Use `transition` and `animation` with the custom easing `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1)`.
- Ensure this animation only fires once when the section scrolls into view (use the existing `.reveal-on-scroll` / `.is-visible` logic).
- Maintain the "Pure Minimalist" typography: JetBrains Mono, huge font for the stat, strictly black and white.
